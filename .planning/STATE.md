# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-03)

**Core value:** A photo editor that feels like a paid pro tool — distinctive LUT filters, deep controls, polished interface — given away free, with edits you can come back to and refine.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Rendering Foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Build order is dependency-driven — AdjustmentStack → RenderEngine → FilterLibrary → Editor UI → Library → Recipes → Export → Polish. Do not reorder.
- Roadmap: LUT pipeline (Phase 2) lands early so all UI decisions are made against the real film aesthetic.
- Roadmap: Polish is a dedicated Phase 7, not scattered across phases — haptic triggers must be final before wiring up feedback.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: LUT authoring pipeline (DaVinci Resolve → Python resample → bundle) requires hands-on validation. Unit-test identity LUT before integrating any production LUT.
- Phase 3: Gesture conflict between canvas and adjustment panels needs real-device testing — Simulator diverges from device.
- Phase 4: PHAsset `.limited` permission mode needs explicit testing. SwiftData iOS 17.x migration path must be tested before shipping any update.
- Phase 6: Custom UTI file association (`.photorecipe`) must be verified on a real device, both export and import flows.
